Code to load data in AWS S3 as AWS lambda Fuction:

import csv
import requests
#all other apropriate libs already be loaded in lambda

#properly call your s3 bucket
s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
bucket = s3.Bucket('your-bucket-name')
key = 'yourfilename.txt'

#you would need to grab the file from somewhere. Use this incomplete line below to get started:
with requests.Session() as s:
    getfile = s.get('yourfilelocation')

#Only then you can write the data into the '/tmp' folder.
with open('/tmp/yourfilename.txt', 'w', newline='') as f:
    w = csv.writer(f)
    w.writerows(filelist)
#upload the data into s3
bucket.upload_file('/tmp/yourfilename.txt', key)
